# Frequency of char in string

## How this work?
Calculate the number of repetion of character in the given string

## Highlights for this project

  - Written in 11 programming languages for benchmarking purpose
  - Here is the demo page to show how the code works. [Demo]

## Benchmark

All the string for benchmarking is "Hello Programming World"
However, in the repository, I keep the string like "Hello C World"(frequency_of_char_in_string.c) or "Hello Haskell World"(frequency_of_char_in_string.hs)

   - The benchmark was taken on Windows 7, 64-bit
   - With 1 exception for Objective-C compiler, I have to use the paiza.io
   - And 1 exception for C#, I use the codingground
